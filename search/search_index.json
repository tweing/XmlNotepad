Back in 1998, we shipped the first XML Notepad, written by Murray Low in C++. Later on it fell behind in support for XML standards and, because we didn\u2019t have time to fix it, we pulled it off MSDN. But Murray apparently did such a nice job that MSDN was inundated with requests to put the notepad back up, so MSDN asked me for a replacement. I was working on System.Xml in C# in 1999, so I figured I could crank out a replacement using the .NET Framework pretty quickly. Well, the problem was it was one of those side projects on my \u201cone-day\u201d list \u2014 you know how that goes! Fortunately, a good friend of mine, Michael Corning, took interest in it, helped hold my feet to the fire, and also added some cool features himself. Dan Doris also took pity on me and helped identify some great bugs. So here we are, finally, with something that should be useful to those who want a quick way to view and edit XML documents. We\u2019ve had over 3 million downloads since then so I\u2019m happy I made the effort. Thanks to everyone who tried it out. For those who know the original version, the interface should look familiar: a tree view on the left synchronized with a node text view on the right and handy nudge toolbar buttons for quick movement of nodes up and down the tree: Because it\u2019s been so long since the first version, I couldn\u2019t resist leveraging the cool stuff in System.Xml and so I added some bells and whistles that the original version didn\u2019t have, including: Incremental search (CTRL+I) in both tree and text views, so that as you type it navigates to the most matched node. Cut/copy/paste with full namespace support in a simple interoperable XML format. Drag/drop support for easy manipulation of the tree, even across different instances of XML Notepad and from the file system. Infinite undo/redo for all edit operations. In-place, pop-up, multi-line editing of large text node values and IntelliSense based on expected elements and attributes. Configurable fonts and colors via the options dialog. Full find/replace dialog with support for regex and XPath expressions. Good performance on large XML documents (loading a 3 MB document in about one second). Instant XML schema validation while you edit with errors and warnings shown in the task list window. Support for custom editors for date, dateTime, time, and color datatypes. HTML viewer for displaying XSLT transformation results. Built-in XML Diff tool. Design and Implementation In the github repo you\u2019ll find the core XmlNotepad dll project, an Application project that builds XmlNotepad.exe, the XmlDiff library projects used in the XML diff feature, a XmlNotepadSetup project for building the .msi installer, and the UnitTests project for testing XML Notepad. The following DGML diagram shows the relationships between the main UI classes. The main form contains all the UI elements from the TaskList to the main XmlTreeView with Resizers in between; it\u2019s the launching point for the dialogs such as FormSearch, FormSchemas, FormOption, and FormAbout. The main tab control contains the XmlTreeView and the XsltViewer for showing XSL output. The XmlTreeView contains a TreeView on the left and a NodeTextView on the right and coordinates scrolling between these two views. Both the TreeView and NodeTextView provide the same IntelliSense editing functionality using a TextEditorOverlay component. The XmlTreeView implements IFindTarget, which is used by the Find dialog (FormSearch) to implement find/replace functionality. The Find dialog supports full text, regex, or XPath expressions and can filter by names or values. Here you see the XPath search, which also provides a table for entering namespace prefix mappings used in the query. Validation, IntelliSense, and Custom Editors The biggest new feature is IntelliSense, which is driven by XML Schema information provided via the SchemaCache. For example, if your element or attribute is defined by an XSD simpleType and this simpleType contains a list of enumeration facets, then you will get a drop-down like this: The way this works is that the Checker runs after each edit operation to validate the document and report errors in the TaskList. This process also puts System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaType information on each element and attribute in the XmlDocument; then, when editing the value of that node, the TextEditorOverlay uses the XmlIntelliSenseProvider to get back a list of possible values. In the above example it returns the values from the simpleType enumeration facets. For element name IntelliSense in the tree view, the XmlIntelliSenseProvider invokes the Checker again, captures GetExpectedParticles and GetExpectedAttributes on the System.Xml.Schema.XmlSchemaValidator, and uses that to provide IntelliSense. The TextEditorOverlay also supports custom editors like the DateTimeEditor or the UriBuilder or ColorBuilder. There are two types of custom editors: IXmlEditors, which are inline editors that replace the default TextBox, and IXmlBuilders, which are popup dialogs like the OpenFileDialog or ColorDialog. The type of editor is derived from the schema type information \u2014 \u201cxs:date\u201d, \u201cxs:time\u201d, \u201cxs:datetime\u201d results in the DateTimeEditor, and \u201cxs:anyURI\u201d results in the UriBuilder. You can also annotate the schema with a custom \u201cvs:builder\u201d attribute in the \u201chttp://schemas.microsoft.com/Visual-Studio-IntelliSense\u201d namespace. See the Help content for more information. Infinite Undo/Redo To implement undo/redo I followed a common design pattern of Command objects with Undo and Redo methods. The UndoManager collects these in a list. Then the state of the UndoManager controls the enabled/disabled state of the Undo/Redo MenuItems. When the user selects the Undo menu item, the Undo method is called on the active command, and that command is pushed onto the Redo stack. Some operations in the editor cause many edits in the tree including the replace-all operation and editing the value of a namespace attribute. (When you change the value of a namespace attribute. every XmlNode bound to that namespace needs to be reconstructed with a new namespace URI, which can obviously affect a lot of nodes in the tree!) So, to make these operations one atomic undo operation, there is a CompoundCommand object that contains a list of smaller edit commands, and this CompoundCommand is put into the UndoManager. Other simpler command objects include the following, which all operate on XmlTreeNode and XmlNode objects: The PasteCommand is special because it takes random XML text off the clipboard and parses it in context of the currently selected element in the tree, inheriting the namespaces in scope. The helper class TreeData uses the special XmlTextReader constructor that takes an XmlParserContext as input. Unit Testing I had to do a good job of testing the new XML Notepad, and I was looking for an excuse to use the new Visual Studio UnitTest projects. The UnitTest runs from the Test Explorer under the Test menu from within Visual Studio, launching XML Notepad and executing all the test methods I\u2019ve written. When the test completes, you can then right-click on the Test Results window and select \u201cCode Coverage Results\u201d. This brings up a summary of how many blocks were covered in each function. You can double-click the row in the list to bring up a color-coded source code view showing exactly which code has been covered. This made it really easy for me to get the code coverage up to about 85 percent. The only trick is that you don\u2019t get code coverage when you run the tests under the debugger, and the UnitTest project creates a file next to your solution called \u201clocaltestrun.testrunconfig\u201d and \u201cXmlNotepad.vsmdi,\u201d which you should not lose. If you do, then code coverage also will not work. Conclusion I hope you enjoy the all new XML Notepad. Feedback and suggestions are welcome, just use the github issues list.

The usual sequence when building up an XML fragment is to use INSERT to enter a new node of the same type as the current node, type in its name then hit TAB to enter its value, then repeat this process and soon you will have quickly built up a document from scratch. Handy Keyboard short cuts include: Key Description TAB navigates from the tree view to the corresponding node value then to the next node in the tree view and so on. SHIFT-TAB does the reverse. Arrow Keys Up/Down/Left/Right do the usual things in the tree view. CTRL+SHIFT+Arrow Nudge the selected node up, down, left or right. HOME/END Navigate to first and last visible nodes in the tree view. PAGE UP/DOWN Scrolls the tree view up or down one page. INSERT Insert another node of the same type. CTRL+INSERT Insert a child element. ALT+INSERT Insert a child attribute. ENTER Enter and exit edit mode on a node name and/or node value. You can also enter edit mode by just typing in some non-navigational keystrokes and what you type will replace what was selected. CTRL+D Duplicate the current node, so you can quickly create similar fragments of XML and then just edit the values. CTRL+F Brings up the Find dialog . CTRL+H Brings up the Find/Replace dialog . CTRL+I Incremental search - as you type a sequence of letters, this search mode will match the next node that starts with that sequence. The more letters you type the more precise the match becomes.
